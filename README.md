  <pre>Tesla Clone with React Native.
- With this project, I created Tesla's mobile user interface.
- There is Tesla's logo and a hamburger menu in the header.
- In the main section, there are images and models of the cars and a subheading stating that users can order online.
- You can switch between pages by swiping up and down on the main screen and see the different models on each page.
- There are two clickable buttons at the bottom. When the buttons are clicked, they give a warning.
